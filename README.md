# project_landing_page_2.0  

I'm going create a site from a given template. The goal is to create my version as close as possible to the design template as possible doesn't have to be pixel-perfect. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch.

Shout out to Joshua KÃ¶ller for the BMW pic, Jean Carlo Salas for the Honda pic, Conor Samuel for the VW Golf pic, Vasilios Muselimis for the Vintage Corolla pic, RalphWilfing for the car meet up pic and <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/car" title="car icons">Car icons created by BZZRINCANTATION - Flaticon</a>
