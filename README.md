# project_landing_page_2.0  

1. Understand the problem

I'm going create a site from a given template. The goal is to my version as close as possible to the design_template as possible doesn't have to be pixel-perfect. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch.

side notes

The font that’s being used in the images is roboto.

Hero text is the statement that appears at the top of a web page.

An easy way to give credit is to put the creator’s name and contact info in a README.

2. Plan

This site has four main sections a header two content sections and a footer so tackle them one by one. 

So start with the content, get all the HTML done before moving on to CSS.

Use google or go back to previous lessons if need be to look something up.

Commit to GitHub frequently.

3. Divide & Conquer 

First things first the header. There is a nav bar where the logo goes on the left and three links on the right. Then we have a heading with some small subtext underneath it and a button to the bottom of that.

Then we have our first content box in this one we have a heading on the top and in the middle we have 4 images with some some text and each image all centred across the main axis.

The next content box we have an inspirational quote hot bang in the centre with the name of the author in the bottom right corner.

and laws but at least we have our footer with a blue box in the middle with a heading and some subtext underneath that and to the right we have a a sign up button on its on it's own.

As for the CSS this is all about Flexbox so I will be using what I've learned to make the the image come to life in my own style. as for the colors I will decide them as I go forward.
