                    <p class="text">The Toyota Corolla is one of the most popular cars of all time worldwide. It was introduced in 1966 and in 1974, it became the best-selling car worldwide. This model currently brings in six figures for Toyota every year. The Corolla
                        gets good milage, has good reliability, and is cheap to fix. What more can you ask for in a entry level car.

                    <p class="text">In 1975 VW added the GTI badge to the golf creating the first hot hatch and has forever been the words benchmark for hot hatches. The GTI has to be one of the most practical sports cars around, it's fast for most, it's stylish, it
                        has a premium feel, it's reliable and the resent models have all the gadgets. The list goes on I mean come on it ticks all the boxes it's the perfect all rounder.

                    <p class="text">The Civic is one of hondas top selling models every year since it was introduced in 1972. Your average Joe on the street knows the Honda civic by name witch says a lot. The Civic also has great resale value because of it's bulletproof
                        engines. Civics are very safe with a 5-star safety rating from NHTSA and multiple Top Safety Pick awards from IIHS, civics has proven to be one of the safest cars around. Plus there earlier sporty engine options used to rev to
                        the high heavens with a very nice sound and I will forever love them for that.

                    <p class="text">So the BMW 3 Series is my favourite car of all time and it's not even close. The 3 series started production in 1975 the 3 Series is Bm's best selling model accounting for 30% of its annual sales of it's cars. The 3 Series is currently
                        on it's seventh generation my personal pick of the bunch has to be the her self the second gen E30. where do I even start, lets start with the shape man the engineers who worked on this car must of only had rulers because there
                        is not a curve in sight and I love it. In South Africa where I grew up it is affectionately called the box I wonder why but seriously it's a beauty from every angle and I love them all weather it's the wagon, sedan, coupe and the
